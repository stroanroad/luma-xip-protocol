# Contributing to XIP Protocol / Luma Core

Thank you for your interest in Luma Core and the XIP Protocol.

At this stage, the project operates as a controlled, standards-track specification intended for
sovereign deployments, financial infrastructure, and regulated sectors.

## 1. Public Contributions

Public issue reports and high-level suggestions are welcome.

However, unsolicited pull requests or code/spec contributions:

- may be closed without review,
- do not grant any rights or expectations of authorship, compensation, or attribution.

## 2. Formal Collaboration

Any deeper technical collaboration, code contribution, or spec text change requires:

- a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA),
- a signed Contributor or Collaboration Agreement,
- explicit written approval from the project maintainer.

This protects the integrity of the standard, the patent position, and sovereign deployments.

## 3. IP and Licence

By submitting any feedback, suggestion, or contribution (including via issues), you agree that:

- the Luma Core project may use, adapt, or ignore your input at its sole discretion,
- you grant a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free licence to use your contribution as
  part of Luma Core and XIP Protocol,
- you retain no claim over governance, ownership, or royalties of the project.

If you do not agree with these terms, please do not submit contributions.
